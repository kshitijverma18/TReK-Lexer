# TReK
A small language lexical analyzer which takes the source code in the form of sentences and breaks into a series of tokens, by removing any whitespace or comments 
in the source code.

# Usage
Compile using
<pre><code>gcc -o lexer lexer.c</code></pre>

Place the test file containing the code in the same directory and run as
<pre><code>./lexer [filename]</code></pre>
